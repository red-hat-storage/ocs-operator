                            description: |-
                              dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                              volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                              core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                              When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                              the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                              provisioner.
                              This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                              if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                              compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                              both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                              value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                              When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                              dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                              There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                              * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                              * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                specified.
                              * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                in any namespaces.
                              (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                              (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                        The grace period is the duration in seconds after the processes running in the pod are sent

                                    The number of chunks required to recover an object when any single OSD is lost is the same
                                    as dataChunks so be aware that the larger the number of data chunks, the higher the cost of recovery.

                                  dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                  volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                  core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                  When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                  the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                  provisioner.
                                  This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                  if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                  compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                  both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                  value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                  When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                  dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                  * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                    allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                  * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                    preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                    specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                    in any namespaces.
                                  (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                  (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                          core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                          When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                          the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic

                          dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                          There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                          * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                            allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                          * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                            preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                            specified.
                          * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                            in any namespaces.
                          (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                      Rook will make a best-effort attempt to automatically detect CIDR address ranges for given
                      network attachment definitions. Rook's methods are robust but may be imprecise for
                      sufficiently complicated networks. Rook's auto-detection process obtains a new IP address
                      lease for each CephCluster reconcile. If Rook fails to detect, incorrectly detects, only
                      partially detects, or if underlying networks do not support reusing old IP addresses, it is
                      best to use the 'addressRanges' config section to specify CIDR ranges for the Ceph cluster.

                              incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                              to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                              for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                              MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.

                              MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                              between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                              The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                              or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                              In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                              |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                              - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                              scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                              violate MaxSkew(1).
                              - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                              When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                              to topologies that satisfy it.
                              It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                              MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                              When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                              Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                              And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                              this value has no effect on scheduling.
                              As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                              scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                              If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                              Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                              When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                              For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                              labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                              | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                              |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                              The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                              In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                              because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                              it will violate MaxSkew.

                              We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and try to put balanced number

                              nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy.
                              e.g. If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.

                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                provisioner.
                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                provisioner.
                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.

                                  MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                  between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                  The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                  or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                  In this case, the global minimum is 1.

                                  - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                  scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                  violate MaxSkew(1).
                                  - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                  to topologies that satisfy it.
                                  It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                  MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                  When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                  Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                  And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                  this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                  As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                  scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                  If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                  Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                  When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                  The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                  In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                  because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                  it will violate MaxSkew.

                                  MatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select the pods over which
                                  spreading will be calculated. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                  incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are ANDed with labelSelector
                                  to select the group of existing pods over which spreading will be calculated
                                  for the incoming pod. The same key is forbidden to exist in both MatchLabelKeys and LabelSelector.
                                  MatchLabelKeys cannot be set when LabelSelector isn't set.
                                  Keys that don't exist in the incoming pod labels will
                                  be ignored. A null or empty list means only match against labelSelector.

                                  This is a beta field and requires the MatchLabelKeysInPodTopologySpread feature gate to be enabled (enabled by default).

                                  MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                                  between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                                  The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                                  or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                                  In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                                  - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                                  scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                                  violate MaxSkew(1).
                                  - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                                  When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                                  to topologies that satisfy it.
                                  It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                                  MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                                  When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                                  Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                                  And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                                  this value has no effect on scheduling.
                                  As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                                  scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                                  If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                                  Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                                  When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                                  labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                                  | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                                  |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                                  The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                                  In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                  because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                  it will violate MaxSkew.

                                dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of
                                the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                provisioner.
                                This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                  preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                  specified.
                                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                  in any namespaces.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
