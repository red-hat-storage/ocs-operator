                              all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value
                              is specified. (Alpha) Using this field requires the

                                two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows
                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                (Alpha) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
                                feature gate to be enabled.'

                                (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.

                  description: 'ObjectReference contains enough information to let
                    you inspect or modify the referred object. New uses of this type
                    are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when
                    embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored"
                    or "name must be restricted". Those cannot be well described when
                    embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are
                    different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:
                    https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                        field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                        a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                        (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
