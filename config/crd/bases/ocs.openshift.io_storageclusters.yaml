                              disallowed values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                              all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value
                              is specified. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource

                          an error if a disallowed value is specified. (Beta) Using

                              can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2; scheduling
                              it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1)

                              won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.

                              with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1
                              | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number
                              of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\"
                              is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the
                              same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed

                                which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                volume is desired. This may be any local object from
                                a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim
                                object. When this field is specified, volume binding
                                will only succeed if the type of the specified object
                                matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                provisioner. This field will replace the functionality
                                of the DataSource field and as such if both fields
                                are non-empty, they must have the same value. For
                                backwards compatibility, both fields (DataSource and
                                DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically
                                if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                There are two important differences between DataSource
                                and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows
                                two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows
                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
                                feature gate to be enabled.'

                                (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.

                                  We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket", and
                                  try to put balanced number of pods into each bucket.
                                  We define a domain as a particular instance of a
                                  topology. Also, we define an eligible domain as
                                  a domain whose nodes match the node selector. e.g.
                                  If TopologyKey is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each
                                  Node is a domain of that topology. And, if TopologyKey
                                  is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone is a
                                  domain of that topology. It's a required field.

                                  higher precedence to topologies that would help
                                  reduce the skew. A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable"
                                  for an incoming pod if and only if every possible

                                  MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector
                                  spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P

                                  on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1). In other words,

                                  P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than
                                  5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                                  as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                                  cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will
                                  be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the
                                  three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is

                                There are two important differences between DataSource
                                and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows
                                two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef allows
                                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed values
                                (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves all values,
                                and generates an error if a disallowed value is specified.
                                (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
                                feature gate to be enabled.'

                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored"
                    or "name must be restricted". Those cannot be well described when
                    embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are
                    different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:

                        an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go
                        field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                        a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                        (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"
                        (container with index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen
                        only to have some well-defined way of referencing a part of
                        an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is
                        subject to change in the future.'
